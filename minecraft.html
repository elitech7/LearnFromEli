   font-style: normal;">How to beat the Game</h2>
<p>To beat Minecraft you have to get 12 or more eyes of ender, to get them you will have to kill Enderman or trade with piglins. 
You can find Enderman in the nether or overworld to go to the nether you will need to make 4 by 2 square and light it up with flint and steel
To trade with piglins you will need to get gold you can get gold by mining, Once you have about 20-30 gold you will need to go to the nether
and find Piglins to find them you just look around the nether some have gold armor but they will always have a crossbow or a gold sword.
When you find them they might run for you and kill you but all you have to do is drop your gold and they should pick it up and look at it
when they do you have to quickly with a pickaxe mine 2 blocks under them so they cant escape. Then they should give you a random item. But keep
giving them gold till you have 12 or more ender pearls.</p> <p>After that you have to keep running through the nether to find a Nether Fortress.
Nether Fortresses are made out of these dark red bricks. Once you find a nether fortress you should look for blazes, Go on google to see how blazes look like
Try to kill at least 6 or 7 blazes when you kill blazes you get blaze rods with blaze rods you go in a crafting table and put the blaze rods in
one square then when you craft it you should get blaze powder as a result. When you get blaze powder and ender pearls you should open a crafting
table and put the ender pearls in one square and the blaze powder in another square right next to the square with your ender pearls. As a result
you should get eyes of ender. When you get those you will need to go to the overworld again and if you are on computer right click with the
eyes of ender in your hand, if you are on tablet tap and hold with the eyes of ender in your hand. When you do that the 1 eye of ender should fly up.
The direction your eye of ender is pointing you should run that way. When you ran a little throw another eye of ender and keep doing that till
the eye of ender goes down. When it goes down you will have to dig straight down. After you dig you should find this brick underground bunker.
When you do explore the bunker till you find a room with a 3 by 3 portal, break
the spawner too.
put your eyes of ender on the portal and when you see a galaxy jump in it
 and you should be in the end! Break the crystals and kill the dragon.
<strong>Remember if there is purple particles under you get away from them
they kill you.</strong></p>

<p>I like minecraft because It's a creative game for everyone, There is probably
nothing you can't do. The only problem is that it is $6.99 on Tablet and
$26.95 on computer, but I think it is worth the money. I also like it because
the posibilitys never end. It will take a long time to finish all achievments.
It took me almost 3 months! There are 4 gamemodes Spectator, Creative, Survival, and Adventure.
There is 1 special gamemode only on Java Edition, and that would be Hardcore mode.
Where if you die the world deletes. So you have to be careful, you only have one life.
